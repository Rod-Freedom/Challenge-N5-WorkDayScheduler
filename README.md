# Challenge-N5-WorkDayScheduler
Keep your tasks of the day on check!

## **ABOUT THE PROJECT**

The Work Day Scheduler is a tool to store data and sort it by hours of the day.

* Each row changes color in real time depending on the time at course. The past hours will be in gray, the running hour in red, and the future in green.

* The row's color will change as the hours change in the clock, there's no need to refresh the site, as it happens automatically.

* The data for each hour will be saved when clicking the blue button with the floppy-disk. This wil store the data for the rest of the day.

* Each day, all the data resets, so the user can have a fresh start every day. 

* The green button is to check the finished tasks, and the "checked" state will be stored too.

The resources applied for this site are the following:

* Bootstrap:
    * Almost all the style was generated with Bootstrap classes.
    * A CSS file was also deployed to complement Bootstrap.
* JQuery:
    * Large part of the DOM was generated with JQuery.
    * Whole seccions of the HTML where created in a single statement.
    * Event listeners where deployed with JQuery to reduce the number of lines and improve the legibility of the code.
* For JavaScript:
    * HTML classes and ids are assigned constantly. 
    * DOM elements created in loops.
    * Classes and ids where thoroughly assigned to interact with the DOM.
    * Constan access and interaction with the local storage.

## **USAGE**

The site is easy and intuitive to use. At the header, you'll find the actual day date.
The list of hours are only for the workday. The row in red, is te running hour, while the rows in gray are for the past hours and the green ones for the future ðŸ”®.

The right buttons: click the blue one with the floppy-disk to save your tasks, and click the green one when you have finished them.

You may edit or errase the tasks, just save your changes.

Don't worry if you close the Scheduler! It will all be there when you come back (your tasks and progress of the day).
But remember, your data is only stored for the day, so tomorrow, you start fresh.
